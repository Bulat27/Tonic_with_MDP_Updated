Instructions to reproduce the preliminary experiments for Tonic with MDUpdated. The preliminary experiments refer to MinDegreePredictor similarity (Section 5.3.1, Figure...) and USS experiments  (Section 5.3.2, Figure...) experiments, respectively. We provide the scripts to reproduce each "method" from the figures separately as well meta scripts to reproduce all the results.

Before you run the scripts, you need to obtain the MinDegreepPredictor maps for all the snasphots of the corresponding datasets. These are served as "ground truths" for both similarity and USS experiments. This is easily done by running the ...

1 - USS experiments are reproduced using the exec_uss_experiments.py script, which accepts the following parameters
For example...

2 - MinDegreePredictor similarity experiments are reproduced using the ... or ..., which accept the following parameters...
